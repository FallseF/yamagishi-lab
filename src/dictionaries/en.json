          "Conventional wearable devices are obstructive when worn on sensitive areas of the body, such as the palms or soles, where friction is high, making it extremely challenging to measure muscle activity (surface electromyography, sEMG). To address this, we have developed an ultra-thin conductive polymer film (several hundred nm thick) that can be used as a \"nano electronic patch\" directly attached to the skin as a bioelectrode.",
          "Due to its ultra-thinness and flexibility, the nano electronic patch adheres to the skin surface using only van der Waals forces, without requiring adhesives, and achieves comparable signal-to-noise ratios to commercially available gel electrodes for measuring sEMG. Furthermore, we developed new wearable and stretchable interconnects that do not hinder the wearer's natural movements and provide stable electrical connections even during intense physical activities. Combining this with the nano electronic patch, we successfully measured surface sEMG of the palm during baseball pitching, a world first."
